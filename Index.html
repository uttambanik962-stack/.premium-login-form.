1. DESCRIPTION
--------------
This is a modern, creative, and lightweight login form built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The unique feature of this form is the "Light Beam" or "Flashlight" effect that activates when the user toggles password visibility. It also includes a smooth transition between Light and Dark modes.

2. KEY FEATURES
---------------
* Unique Magic Light Beam Effect on password field.
* Smooth Light/Dark Mode toggle.
* Minimalist and Premium UI design.
* Built-in Form Validation (Email & Password).
* Fully Responsive (Works on Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop).
* No External Libraries/Frameworks (No jQuery or Bootstrap needed).
* Clean and well-commented code.

3. WHAT IT DOES (WORKING FEATURES)
----------------------------------
* Password Visibility: Clicking the "Eye" icon reveals the password and triggers the flashlight effect.
* Dark Mode: Toggling the eye icon switches the entire page to a dark theme.
* Validation: If fields are empty during submission, the input borders turn red automatically.
* Input Feedback: Red error borders disappear instantly when the user starts typing.
* Customization: Easy to change colors using CSS variables (:root).
